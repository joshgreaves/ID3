A simple decision tree package written in Julia for a class project. All code relating to inducing decision trees are found in ID3.jl, and some useful helper functions for handling the data in DataPrep.jl. Other scripts include experiments run for a paper I wrote for the class, which demonstrate how to build decision trees.
